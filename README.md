# FloorTrails

A Processing sketch that uses optical flow to create trails. It has been optimised for projecting on the floor, and using a web camera hanging in the ceiling. 

The sketch was used in the third part of the interactive dance performance at [MusicLab vol. 3](https://www.hf.uio.no/ritmo/english/news-and-events/events/musiclab/2018/rhythm/index.html)
at University of Oslo, 15 November 2018. 

## Features ##

- Can use keyboard shortcuts 1, 2, 3 to change between different settings.
